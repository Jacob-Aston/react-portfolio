# React Portfolio ![License badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green)

## Description

This is a react application to display some of my work, and to tell you a little bit about myself and my background. This app is a place where people can find my resume and view my programming portfolio. Where people can read a little bit about me, look at some of my photos, find my socials, and reach out to me via email. While this app started as a class assignment it has proven to be a solid foundation to start down my path as a react developer.

Open a terminal on the root and run `npm i`. Then run `npm run start` to run the app locally. Use `npm run deploy` to build and launch your updates.

## Usage

Use either the dropdown menu or the buttons at the top of the screen to navigate between pages. The buttons at the bottom of the page will take you to some of my social accounts. The projects in the portfolio have links to deployed apps and repositories for the related project. You can reach out to me via email using the contact page. There is a link to my resume on the resume page.
